- Problems faced:

  - One of the problem i faced was understanding what all IPC_TYPES and
    IPC_CMDs are present.

    For IPC_CMDS i grepped the sof includes in the kernel using _CMD_ as
    the search item and i found that there were four results. I used those
    four as possible values for IPC_CMD. (these were present in include/sound/sof/control.h)

    Same was the case with IPC_TYPES, i wasn't sure what all types to
    consider. I took /component runtime config/ types.

    But, i feel this shouldn't pose a problem as we can always extend the
    character array with appropriate types.

    This was the part i was unsure of.

- Instructions to run:

  ./parser datafile.txt

  - I have included 4 data files which i used while debugging my program.
    
    - data_0entries.txt: contains no entries
    - data_1invalid.txt: contains 1 invalid data line, it should be detected while filtering.
    - data_4invalid.txt: contains 4 invalid data lines, they should be detected while filtering.
    - data_invalid.txt: contains an invalid input, the program exits and tells that
                        there is an invalid input in the data file.
			(Like having only 2 of 3 (i.e 2 of IPC_CMD, IPC_TYPE, IPC_SIZE))

- I have checked for memory leaks with valgrind command:

  `valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kings=all ./parser datafile.txt'

  All the allocated blocks were freed and there were no memory leaks.
